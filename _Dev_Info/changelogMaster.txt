Old Polls:
%(http://www.strawpoll.me/10679140) (YES) revert to the legendary/epic affixes.  I added a twist though. I manually merged it with most of the GQ lootaffixes.  let's see if it breaks anything
%(http://www.strawpoll.me/10551741/) (NO) remove legendary/epic affixes. you can keep the items you already got but new ones won't drop anymore at least not until DGA has post100 leveling
%(http://www.strawpoll.me/10550732/) (NO) remove depravities from the grimmest portion of DAIL mod
%(http://www.strawpoll.me/10562759/) (YES) devotion shrines combat only

^Ceno releasing now class, Champion, and own artwork for Elementalist and Terror Knight
^script for DAIL gift icon assortment, playerclass01 complete as test, 100+ entries per mastery by hand :(
^add the lazy mod for people who want auto pickups of stuff - needs more research - I haven't checked it yet
^see additional file anm_problems.txt
^survival mode i can't seem to fix the god spawn issues and the random crashing. use at your own risk.
^add/test a pull script to put stuff back into my offline work dir when I merge something from the wild (if it ever happens) put a bunch of pauses before it runs to be sure it doesn't run by accident. and make it only work if run from the git dir itself.
^if you play multiplayer with other people, if other players aren't in a close vicinity when the (component vendor) npcs appear - it won't be visible to others once they get there, only to the first player
^remove voidcaller items - i'd need an actual list.  not interested in diffing this out right now. it will be a pain.  im expecting Crate to raise the mastery limit beyond 30 so it shouldn't matter later. also i have templated it up to 99 but only 51 will display
^update graphics and naming conventions on the skill components - this is column A in all of the spreadsheet tabs if someone wants to update it and pass it over i will take it spreadsheet name is "masteries yyyy mm dd.xlsm" under \DAIL\database\DAIL\
^reverse spear models
^level75+ epics are not RNG properly? or whats the deal?
	^fiddle with loot tables - are there duplicate entries? need magic script to check this.
	^don't have time for this
^Discord Days: I wanted to propose that you add a new craftable to the game if possible! Aether Clusters!
^My game keeps crashing the moment Loghorrean attacks me, tried 3 times and on the third walked in slowly, stood there and when his projectiles hit me I crashed right away, on DAIL48 atm.
^add ground cleaner for survival mode
^camera acting weird. please read this http://steamcommunity.com/app/219990/discussions/1/357286663687417334/?tscn=1470506321
^IF YOUR READING THIS I CANT GET THE LAST THREE ULTIMATE SKILLS WORKING ON ENGINEER EVERYTHING IS LINKED RIGHT.  is it another arbitrary limit on the engine??? ! 
^look into merging the dawn of heroes music files into ambient mix
^Door to survival arena in multiplayer can not be gone through except by host others get stuck on invisible wall. This was on version 0050

0055 - 
[9/8/2016]K Merged Mastery Selection UI improvement


*MISC UI
	30 mastery UI restored.. for now!
	*Cenobite class selection points to Fangshi
	*Fangshi tree titled Coronus
	*Square icons with round borders look like crap, Ranger, Fangshi, Arelquin, Priest's "Great Charm of Water" icon, Frost Knight's "Glaciacian" icon, Terror Knight "Blood Rage" "Lust for Carnage"
	*Engineer skills beyond T9? Missing 3 skill information.
	*Terror Knight tagSkillClassDescription13 missing


*make crucible merger magically happen at install time
*make all of the actual modules built using ARZballer.exe from Jiaco
	.bat file
	various options available
	make it clean enough for others to contribute permutations to the builder/installer script :D
*blow away the loot drops tables that conflict with grim quest
	add back non replacing vanilla tables
	manually grep in the legendary / epic affixes
	winning @ life & grim dawn
*Someone mentioned it before but can also confirm Illusionist's changeling pets being stationary. 
	no clue on this. gonna leave it till later
*While Frost Knight is looking much better, it's still got broken parts.
	It looks like Frost Aura is not itself, but rather one of the old attack skills, including the modifiers.
	The second modifier has a tag not found error for the name as well, tagFKSkillName02C.
	Howling Wind is missing the graphic (description mentions a cone of cold) and bizarrely has poison damage.
	Path of Frost's built-in devotion skill has another tag not found error for the pet it summons, tagPetWraith.
	Hoarfrost modifier for Frost Blast says it increases the AoE, but has no radius stat to do so.
	Cold Steel reads as a WPS (and was before IIRC) but only has passive stats, including acid and poison damage, not to mention a cold to acid conversion.
*"Priest" problems
	Still no offensive summons in Priest like there should be either, makes the pet bonuses it has useless by itself.
	update "priest" to be whatever is in the latest dawn of heroes update
*Oh! I found vendor potions in SX. I'm not finding them on B, but I transferred some over... they do nothing.
*bony craftsman (from potion) illusion potions not useable
*potion merchant for arch necromancer has only health/mana pots to sell, no comps
*I can't zoom out as far in DAIL as I am in vanilla - any advice or is something wrong?
*(SURVIVAL MODE RELATED( think some dbr-files are referencing on missing dbr files. For example
	Code:
	\DAIL - Survival\database\records\proxies\ascend_1\pool_aetherial08.dbr
	has a reference to
	Code:
	survival/creatures/wavespawn/ascend_1/enemy_gazer02b.dbr
	, but as far as i can see, there is no enemy_gazer02b.dbr?! 

0054 - 2016-09-02 1:43 AM
add in a script to pull shit from XADAIL folder when getting updates from git (other people are contributing code now!!!!!)
removed extra dirs that are generated at build time - removed from git that is
	maybe the repo won't be as scary. (or huge) :P
	make fully self regenerating DAIL module folders
check demolitionist and occultist max mastery levels -> I think I needn to do a little replacer for training.dbr for the first 6 masteries. i blew it away last update.. this is np. is fixed now.
give credit to kriescher and Arendeth for making my .bat files great again
add Kathanious as very special credit for doing DAIL's very first pull request and direct github update
update DGA to 0.5 - canceled this! there is no 0.5
devotion is capped @ 50 ??!?!?! - really??!?!? doesn't seem like it to me.

		database/records/game/gameengine.dbr

review these errors -> https://www.dropbox.com/s/da9vbgrs283jf5b/grimstash%20error%20log.txt?dl=0
	gonna just ignore those errors for now. i found all the files and tags np
added a new shared spreadsheet for selecting item graphics. link is -> ??? https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13WEswVGamETKAVfI1xBPGSsQlOJCeNWWLlEP5rxRayM/edit?usp=sharing
Im getting a weird bug where the mastery icon of Engineer, all the skill icons of Terror Knight and Elementalist are 1/4 the size of normal. I had this issue in DAIL51 HF2 as well.
	no its fine. its a little bit of trickyness to get 51 masteries to appear in mastery selection. unfortunately the windows are shared.

	In Memory of:Gogo the Chaotic Mellon, lost in the service of Cairn
	is that default to the game or added very randomly by a mod?
	found it -> http://www.grimdawn.com/forums/showthread.php?p=422356#post422356
My Cadence skill still has the %weap damage from before the patch, not the upgraded one like in main campain :/ 
	seems to be fixed now.. rebuilt all of hte .arz files from a delete to be sure.
If you select Illusionist, it will say ranger instead but the skill tree is fine.
add .bat to the updater xagit.bat
cleaned up xagit.bat quite a bit
Hasn't been true, at least, for me since you removed the maps. Your .lua script is borked. (referring to one shot doors for dungeons like sot and boc)
	think i fixed it. removed the need to kill the door boss - dont have time to test
more repository scrubbing completed. less garbage and more flavour should be available now
BTW Frost Knight is still messed up, lines going out to an empty spot where there should be a skill, Howling Wind placed as if it requires 50 points in the mastery when it needs 32, and Priest is still lacking the pet summon it's supposed to have. I think your pick and choose merging of Dawn of Heroes isn't really working out. 
	it is fixed along some other bugs too i found ;o
Skill Elementalist call "Ice Wall " put point but not change. 
	updated to zenit 0.2c 
	checked zenith itself.
	this is a zenith problem. not dail
	seems that something changse in the files but the display never changes.. updated the skill description to the latest version
Also getting an issue where the modded music isnt playing in devil's crossing. I switched back to DAIL51 and it worked again 
	likely i need to move the files to \mod\ from teh root music folder. np
	fixed. \sound\ was bad  \sound\mod\ was good. shrug this includes changing the paths back int he dbr files.
DAIL version number doesn't show up.
	it does show up ;o
potions are not dropping for people. FML TEST IT MOFO. change everything to 25% chance for potion add more potion npcs (x2) and remove the .bak replacer for SX/X modes.
	ok i killed a bunch 5% is too low. increasing to 35% across the board.
	added non component npcs to compensate for easy potion drops
merge in eternal 0967 changes to my changes (damnit)  I made custom directories for all of his stuff so that factions and other stuff wouldnt break by playing the mod.. anyways np must use the power of the REGEX
	start by isolating the changes from 966 to 967
	was a mess but its done. well see how it goes.
text files deleted - fixed

0052 - hotfix 1 for crucible installer only - 2:32 PM 8/9/2016
used Arendeth updates to make it work for people including text change to remind people what to / not do
	contemplate buum.7z + dail-cruzible.7z and the changes thereign

0052 - 9:16 PM 8/8/2016
make my .bat files great again
	http://www.grimdawn.com/forums/showpost.php?p=418859&postcount=2367
	http://www.grimdawn.com/forums/showpost.php?p=421342&postcount=2488
merged in 1.0.0.5 changes
	compared 1.0.0.5 against 1.0.0.4HF2
	925 new/changed files in the database
	took that diff and merged differences to existing DAIL
	very few things needed to be changed :D
check to make sure im not overwriting the skills for masteries 1 to 6 in every DAIL mod folder.
frost knight 3 skills not  displaying?  - will go back to thread if its displayed but simply not working. anyways.
DAIL - Survival\database\records\creatures\gods is missing, thats why the gods are insta-death. I compiled your sources with the missing files and survival worked with spawning gods. 
add Kieran Cooper to credits for naming stuff and as component vendor npc
DAIL-0051hf2, B mode: either i'm really unlucky or those elusive Merchant Potions still not dropping after 4 hours of intense gameplay((( 
	your unlucky
	other people reporting it working just fine
So I noticed one other thing, I don't have the number in the top left of the DAIL Version.
finish the patcher for DAIL-Crucible
	
0051 - HOT FIX 2 - 7:19 AM 8/6/2016
fixed dga for real.... was alot of files i forgot in the patcher
		
0051 - HOT FIX 1 - 8:49 PM 8/5/2016
Crucible merged - separate installer available. will run a patch on 1.0.0.5 files.  ill make a new one each time. you have to "integrity check" the DLC each time.
	this is a good case for having a CLI arz repacker because then i can just pack in my changes into YOUR crucible @ install time instead of this nasty business im doing now.
	http://www.grimdawn.com/forums/showthread.php?p=419600#post419600	
	cant get patch to work will upload it soon i promise ;o
fixed bug with DGA .arc file missing in NSIS installer
	
0051 - 6:49 PM 8/5/2016
IF YOUR READING THIS I CANT GET THE LAST THREE ULTIMATE SKILLS WORKING ON ENGINEER EVERYTHING IS LINKED RIGHT.  is it another arbitrary limit on the engine??? ! 
potions drop+work btw. tested in live stream. thanks Samael187 for reminding me to check.
I'm not able to assign skills to some celestial powers like ghoulish hunger or messenger of war or spear of heavens... Is this a bug or is there something that i don't know about these powers? I'm on 0050 X mode, and i'm a level 36 Kensai (fangshi + warfare). And I made a clean install for 0050.
	i wanna see his char file. asking for it.
	people saying its fine.. shrug
Davood said that Survival isn't supposed to give points. Are you saying it still does? 
	its fine. no extra skill points given. just checked the .lua files and re-removed the rewards
is there a way to fix the class not found glitch when you enter the character select screen ?
	this should be fixed. do you use 50HF1 ???
http://www.grimdawn.com/forums/showpost.php?p=417031&postcount=2340
	checking into this
	nevermind
clergy's amulet missing texture
	fixed - was missing source/asset folder entries from NCFF. moar uploading your source bro
	not actually fixed until i complete task below "merge ncff 0.58" i might move that to 0052 since its a BEAST of a task every time.
the ultimate mastery level of the ranger class does not grant health - fixed, mana was also lacking
sorry but i don't know how the lost treasures feature work in Ultimate ? do i need to find all 20 one shot chest before the guardian appears ? i alrdy find some one shot chest and when i returned in new session nothing appears. thank you vm.
	I thin i need to re enable the screipts for this sorry.
	will do some medium level testing. i dont have much time for this anymore.

add back depravities into creatures folder and increase size to normal size
cancel analysis of this. atrosatiro is back**Davo, i'm not sure if its from the harlequin mastery itself or not but at version 48 at max level 16 Zhanni swords - they are at 0 HP, but at level 15 they work just fine, it seems that the 16th point of the skill makes the HP of the summons 0 and its basically not allowing any summons

0049 - 3:22 AM 7/17/2016
introducing RAID MODE (SX and ASX) - insanely hard enemies x 1000000000000
All versions of X/AX/SX/ASX have increased loot quality as well.
fixed some scripts for merging scripts that merged scripts
loading screen image changed - sorry about version 48 ;o
update omega scripts in x mode (whuups) add it as a script mk
soldier+defense=soldier??? wtf? After restarting session, my defense+soldier (called soldier) now suddenly has 2x soldier masteries in the mastery-window. But I can still use defense abilities that I had on my actionbar. 
Doing "And Not a Drop to Drink" quest. "Viloth the Corruptor" did not spawn in Devil's Aquifer, unable to finish quest. "Primordian, the Forgotten One" was in it's place. - did spawn for me. maybe you didnt go all the way in.
BUG: When I craft Imbuded Silver I gain a Scavenged Plating instead. I have tried this 3 times and have the same result each time.  are you sure ? i got imbued silver. which version?
revamped the OP on gd forums quite extensively. it should read better now
Discord Days: SoT gate closes like in vanilla in 0048 - fixed - re added old script
THIS IS FOR SCREENSHOTS people keep showing me issues. i need to know which version. differentiate each mode with a little (X etc) in the upper left next to the difficulty.  IE x mode 0049 on ult is ULTIMATE (X 0049 )
gameengine.dbr loot quality increase for X/AX/SX/ASX MODE DO EEET
What happens;  I run into a pack pop Ice Citadel and let my maxed out Stormcall/Thunderclap + Devotion - Flame Torrent, melt the enemies down.  It seems to only crash when larger-sized enemies are engaged with me, or massive amounts of mobs.  Happened in the Necropolis, as well as the Boss troll guy(s) in Eastern Marsh.
	test this myself in DAIL - get the crash to happen - nah large creatures didnt crash it. need to ask people to send me saved game and then i can try in exactly the same situations
x	if crash successful - then test conditions with JUST the mod this mastery is from
x		report findings to ceno - if crash x2
x	repeat both above steps for cenobite - also round 8/9 in survival if i can't crash in same circumstances
x		report findings to cftx - if crash x2
update to omega 0.6
update to DGA 0.4b
	WareBare: k, forgot to remove the enemy count UI.Notify when they spawn :) hope thats the only debugging UI.Notify I forgot - WareBare: cArea.lua line 392
update to ncff 0.56

0048 - 6:44 PM 7/14/2016
Legandary bosses aren't dropping boss souls from Omega at all! Tried both "minor" legendaries like that wasp Okami mentioned and bosses like Warden. But essence requirement for omega went from 40 to 28, so some parts of v0.5 work!

mogdrogan fix from 0047 didnt work fro everyone. made a better mogdrogan fix. cough up those iron bits people! now it works for reals i tested it :P
food/drinks give mana again. yay i broke it in 0042 i think
create spreadsheet update for 99 masteries... just in case. added some unused masteries to it in advance if we want to start naming them. 272 missing names people. get to it !
add Aaron Barton and SL AM to credits for names
test the omega changes - works
check for baron wradlith in spined cove - fix if needed - hes there
update omega mod to 0.52
this seems like a vanilla problem. can someone tell me i not crazy on this? if so lets complain to crate.  -> Hey, still having an issue with some items rolling with the "Replicating Missile" proc on them, however the cooldown is sometimes replaced with an energy cost
more x-mode stuff: Just set healthGainOnKillPct to 100 and healthGainOnKillDifficulty to 0 for every entity in records/creatures/enemies/boss&quest. 

0047 - 4:08 AM 7/13/2016

(component vendor click) Also, if you have a bunch of these text items in your inventory each time you enter a game you get the red text for each of them. So if you have 20 you get 20 messages.  gonna fix this with what im doing on next line
clicky summons in pack = annoying. make a potion that uses a skill slot. is stackable and chooses a random npc 
	step 1 get teh potion to drop and stack in inventory
	step 2 get the clicky added to dbr files
	step 3 get it to actually trigger the dail.summon.npc()
the "Rhowari Legacy"-quest is broken now. The quest-npc gives you the quest, you find spirit/runed stone as normal - but once you arrive at the shrine it's still cleansed from previous DAIL versions. - added option to the quest giver if you have over 100k iron
increase overall loot quality in x mode
	drop rates are the same but loot quality has been drastically increased, every item will have a prefix and suffix, no item will have only a prefix or only a suffix.
update omega mod to 0.5

Njorunn : Rupture skill-tag is still bugged in 0045 (elementalist tree  TagClass12SkillName12B not found (Elementalist) fix it 
no xp again. whoops fixed for real. modeled the formula and everything
customize component vendor popups to have specific text for specific vendor - nah.. now you can choose when to summon them it doesn't matter
Discord Days: @Davood - only getting demo and soldier scrolls! Had 5 so far and no other mastery is dropping. - i played with the RNG a little. lets see how it works out.
check "Grove keeper" skill... was attached to rogue. wtf  -   fixed.   priest was renamed back to priest :D even though the file says ench.. too many name changes makes jack a very sad boy
nope. no idea why its crashing randomly. check hex codes used for quests in survival - add in code to gate the codes used or change them to the multiplayer codes always... testing :(
skip this for now - 0.4 DGA is coming soon check that missing harpy tag in DGA. is it me or is it DGA ? :P i need a screenshot damnit.  i keep killing them too fast.
Light of Empyrion is bugged too.It procs on your attacks instead of being on when you get hit, and instead now it hits yourself somehow. is this somethign i need to fix?  re-merged cornucopia. seems lots of files were missing
some affix bugs. i think its fixed
update to ncff 0.55 - done with some of the affixes and items. but not all. there were too many. far too many :(
setup magic clicking script from Ceno for ease-of-building - hmm nah its going to take less time to click myself than to get it working right ;o

0045 - 2:02 PM 7/11/2016
added a 'lite' installer for those who dont care much for extra audio - installer went from 328 MB down to 141 MB - already uploaded a 0044 BUILD version of it. in teh future I will try and make this and the other one even smaller (TQ masteries adds 100 megs by itself ...)
something is wrong we are seeing too many soldier and demo vendors popping. this isnt random there are 35 possible npcs we should see more variety - i think i fixed it. lets see what people say....
soldiers arlequin gift of dail +1/+1 not working. say unknown skill for arlequin side.
scale x-mode xp to playerLevel/10*(base xp reward formula)
Loot quality has been increased slightly overall for X/AX mode. where as in regular modes there is a chance of 0 affixes on epic/leg items.  in X/AX mode. leg/epic items ALWAYS have affixes :D
removed cornucopia affix changes - they are really really bugged atm. im not going to fix them since they are in flux
lower crossing zombeis not giving xp in x mode - going to ask for a screenshot of the zombie names and location. so i can trace it.
cant fix this. will make it "intended" for now - adding it to TODO: for whenever. Discord Days: And if you play multiplayer with other people, if other players aren't in a close vicinity when the npc appears - it won't be visible to others once they get there, only to the first player
Discord Days: Apprentice staff bp still drops and crashes if you hover mouse over it - REMOVE IT - removed blueprint from drop tables
update installer documentation. WTF is X/AX mode anywways.
think about deconstructing items quest / something - nevermind wanebare is taking care of it
tagCraftWeap2Scythe01 -> missing tag from Dawn of Heroes
TagClass12SkillName12B not found (Elementalist) fix it
fix (H)arlequin  and terror knight mastery skillups so no gaps for special modifiers - not sure this was the problem.  maybe remove the decimals.. hmmm
dga crystal reflect too much??? - so what. let wanebare worry about this.

the dismantle function doesn't work in DGA for some reasons. - not sure. let's see how DGA 0.4 pans out.. i comapred my rifts folder its identical wehre it matters.. with  DGA 0.31
update dawn of heroes to 2.1
update omega mod to 0.4
check xp of x mode to see if it is working on stuff. - it works after clean build. derp derp derp derp derp

0044 - 4:57 AM 7/9/2016
releasing this early so people can enjoy the critical bug fixes i deployed and X/AX mode.
fix 5% spawn chance npc announcement stuff.. I want it to announce that an npc has arrived. maybe even which npc.. dunno hmmmm it worsk nevermind
ripped apart my mod folders again. deleted all .dbr files duplicated in grim dawn base dir - this will make things a bit smaller
something is up with triggered areas . since i  removed world01.map eveything isnt triggering properly hmmmm damnit IE cellar door.. can't complete 2nd quest of main game. FIXED. just needed a script refresher :D
look into new mode DAIL - X/AX = reduced spawns, increased difficulty w/ grimmest boss spawns, minus the two grimmest hero spawns, increased % for component vendors to pop and other stuff increased too.. hint:7
quest related triggers being weird still. i blaeme lua. must fix. - feeksd
change loot drops back to super epic time - manually merged a bunch of files. i wonder whats broken kekekeke

0043 - 3:00 AM 7/8/2016
NSIS installer 477 -> 484 lines.  That is almost 0.5K with that increase....
many small creatures were sacrificed to perform the blood ritual to reduce the file size even further from 300MB down to 150 MB, also super maximum multiplayer compatibility has been activated.
expect to see further improvements on file size in the future
i fiddled with loot tables . let me know how it went.
nevermind seems to be known bug - http://steamcommunity.com/app/219990/discussions/0/351660338731677804/ - quest rewards not always matching actual reward - no idea - someone gave an example of the message for beating the game showing 1 leg and the item they got being a different one entirely.
can i fiddle with the map using purely LUA?
	doors to bastion of chaos and torment are not permanently locked upon first use.  this wway you still need skeleton keys if you screw up but at least you can resume and finish it if you die.
	npc spawns via script happening just a bit of a lua nub.  thanks to wanesbarez and okami29 i am learning stuff now
fix spirit bonus stat-ups
review save file from mood to see about tooltip lag (aederyn white) - no tooltip lag for me maybe its fixed? lets ask mood after 0043 update. if not fixed then i will see about setting up a real test.. this is not a bug per se but i understand it can be annoying and ruin QoL
deleted extra class stuff from wanez folders.. will make compilation slightly smaller
finished adding "Reginald's Wild Night" to (H)arlequin skills.
(H)arlequin expanded to level 100 mastery cap with appropriate bonuses
(H)arlequin component vendor added

0042 - 2:12 AM 7/5/2016
HF2 - oops forgot the database folders for survival/rift
HF1 - oops little hotfix GQ masteries go to 100 now :P
Seriously, and I mean SERIOUSLY cleaned up NSIS installer.
	old method would have put this file @ 950 MB
	new method puts it at 517MB
	super ninja mode that I setup weighs in @ 311MB IE. black magic.
	NSIS installer was 312 lines, is now 477 lines
MP SHOULD NOW WORK BETTER. rebuilt all the DAIL folders and updaters so that version compatibility can actually happen no more base game modding - this was a doozy. tested seems to work. enjoy MP peoples
component vendors not selling anything .. sorry about this. anyway its fixed.
clean up the excel builder some more !
ADD Trevor Manson to credits for names, and use up a component vendor placeholder slot with his name
ADD Oleg Martynov to credits for names, and use up a component vendor placeholder slot with his name
review cornucopia affixes -> need to remove "corn" or "_corn" from them. we are overwriting not duplicating mk - it was an item skill. just one. rifthound.
Release the (H)arlequin. update it later - its released. weird icon in upper left seems to be problem with original files. leaving it there for future repair / updates.
the Soul Collector NPC in the rift hideout appears to be bugged. Clicking on him currently does nothing. 
	Thats a DAIL issue.
	Because I believe Davood is checking this thread: Probably a conversation asset missing otherwise the NPC wouldn't appear at all.
	got it and fixed it thanks wanez ;o
Feedback from Mood
	A loading-screen hint for the "Good looking mod" that tells you to check the corpse outside Devil's Crossing (that feature was changed and the npc was moved to Outcast room) - oops fixed.
	A loading-screen hint for the omega-mod tells you to talk to the NPC in Devil's Crossing to start the quest - but it omits the detail about it only working in Ultimate - should probably be added! - oops fixed
	Would you consider adding an 1-million iron bits option to buy exp for from your custom characters (seeing as 100 000 bits is the highest at the moment).
	regarding the xp.. there is a 1 million iron bit option isnt there??? anyways ill add a 1 million 10 million and 100 million option :D  ok i also threw in a 1 billion option just in case for DGA leveling later on :P
	Will you invent a new use for the skeleton key now that it's completely obsolete with SoT/BoC gates gone? - from my understanding DGA uses skeleton keys for some of the portals you can spawn. so im happy with that, correct me if im wrong and ill add a use for them or just remove them ($$$ or XP probably)
	I saw you are going to correct the custom-mastery aug vendors in the next version - will you also correct their vendor formulas? Yesterday I could sell a belt to them for 4.1 million iron bits. They buy all gear at very high prices. I'm currently at 40 million iron bits due to this "bug" (while I should have been at around 5 million otherwise). It invalidates bothering to open chests and sell to normal vendors completely. I hope it will be changed!  should be ok now

0041 - 4:53 AM 7/1/2016
add a note in the OP about hosting dail MP games
add same note to the steam group discussions
grim quest lich animation fix added
try koba0100 suggestion to force template (that he created) over 30 masteries. probably won't work. only way to find out is to try :D - FAILED. got blank screen. its hard coded @30 for now. anyways it gave me some formatting ideas for the futur
removed narisk from survival mode. sorry casuls. you have to farm like real players now 
included the rest of my excel generators. sharing is caring
MERGED - merge http://www.grimdawn.com/forums/showthread.php?t=41847 and give appropriate credit - yeah the installer is going to be huge now hah
cleaned up my excel item, loottable and tag builder. now i can expand it easier.
check DGA loot tables. - FIXED - maybe. not sure. i replaced d01_chesthero_all_01.dbr and set it to ignore in my replication scripts
added some DAIL tags to starting areas ikon, dc and homestead so you know whiich version your in. and helps when you take testing screenshots :D
add +1/+2 to all combinations of masteries as components that only fits into amulet.  a few of each will appear as additional purchasable goods on all skill merchants
review legendary affixes / drops for merging with GQ - here is the final analysis regarding loottable folder where the affixes are assigned:
	102 files were changed due to GQ merging
	418 files were not changed
	so this means 20% of the drops will be normal / Grim Quest related; while the other 80% will have affixes like normal (legendary affixes).  
	I tested this by adventuring and i got a mixture of affixed and non affixed legendaries/epics with a mixture of suffix/prefix or both or none
	This feels more natural IMHO than having affixes on every epic / legendary item. since they already have unique effects; you can consider them to be base items.

0040 - 9:28 PM 6/29/2016
hotfix sorry about the gq masteries not properly giving stats
+1 to all skills doesn't work for custom masteries - yes it does
+1 to all skills for specific new mastery - it works just fine
+ to specific skill - works

poll result 1 -> leave legendary stuff in place - got it.  0041 will work on fixing those that broke due to Grim Quest merge
poll result 2 -> leave depravities in place - got it.  close 2nd to removing depravities - ill fix the drops if i can - fixed-ish need to test or let others test ;o
poll result 3 -> change shrines to combat only - got it.  will do this  easy peasy. DONE EXCEPT for mogdrogan shrine
removed unnecessary files from \DAIL\database\DAIL\*
finish documenting the ??? stuff in README
shrink the build by removing the GQ resource files after a copy and update - no need it isn't cooked into the installer
FIXED - All GQ Masteries are bugged in DAIL - eternal (probably means RIFT) and DAIL - survival. You can use them and they cost mana but nothing happens. In DAIL they work fine.
check eternal mod items and item skills and god drops - seems same as original eternal mod
extend all 9 GQ masteries to level 100 max w appropriate bonuses (FML)
FIXED - try changing factions in eternalmod to see if we can avoid the changing all factions to nemesis stuff...
Little bit of file copying and file replace action as follows :D
	records/creatures/anomalies/	->		survival/creatures/anomalies/
	records/creatures/enemies/		->		survival/creatures/enemies/
	records/creatures/wavespawn/	->		survival/creatures/wavespawn/
	records/creatures/gods/			->		survival/creatures/gods/
	faction_necromancers.dbr		-> 		faction_outlaw.dbr
	faction_kymonzealots.dbr		-> 		faction_outlaw.dbr
+non overwrite of all base creature data for those same folders.
+kymon/vigil faction changed to cronley faction. :D
+try it and let me know if it worked. seems to work for me anyways.

0017 - 10:30 AM 5/29/2016

grimmest 0.666 proxies injected -proxy pool values left intact.. its actually not bad in 0666

0015 - 10:31 AM 5/25/2016

no more level 1 uber items shoudl appear. affixes should roll more in line with item level now
added 20% mana recovery to food/con pots

0014 - 5:16 PM 5/24/2016
Set potions/ointments to stack to 1000 instead of 100
xp recurved again! sorry :P see image at top of post
10 skills per level (instead of 2) after level 90 to 100 (so total of 100 skill points from 91 to 100 !)
reverted items back to being leveled. garbage was consistantly dropping for high level characters (unacceptable)
updated survival to 0.6

SoT and BoC
*doors have been forcibly removed. giving multiplayer games more uptime
in the event of a lag raid death from the massive amount of spawns.
*the teleports still dont work inside but thats ok. you can set one up just outside and run back in if you die.

Changes that require updating the main game database.arz
->MaxDevotion set to 59 (maximum legitimately possible in maingame atm)
->All masteries go to level 100 now
->your maingame saves STILL won't be broken with this change

0011 - 2:48 PM 5/23/2016
XP can be curved - monster xp was set to 25% of regular.
I've changed monster xp to 80% of regular and I've curved the xp using a
math formula so that xp is "vanilla" until level 50ish then it ramps up
quickly to 53% extra xp per level by 100
Omega updated to 0.1k
Surival mode updated to 0.41
Removed level restrictions on items and affixes
Rift/Mapping mod from WareBare has been added successfully! As a separate mod since its it's own world.
I toned back the spawns a bit more. should'nt be any x4 purple bosses anymore.

0010 - 10:20 AM 5/22/2016
fixed the icons so they aren't upside down
cleaned up alot more tags
omegamod update to version J - many bugfixes and new omega bosses added as well as 3 new icons
added a "DAIL - Survival" build as an alternative to leveling and
gearing up if you just want to fight waves of monsters one after another
in the "GrimDawn: Eternal" from PrincessLuna (imho it is Princess LUA)

0009 - 10:24 PM 5/21/2016
quick fix for projectiles and other fx

0008 - 1:58 PM 5/21/2016
merged cftx ranger/necro mod
also renamed the arachnophobia mod because if it has a diff name they
wont be able to play with regular DAIL users. its just a graphical thing
so why restrict them?
cleaned up some tags and .tex files
next up: updates on necro, coronus, grimmest dawn, and any release of the rift mod will be incorporated.
maybe some initial research into cornucopia.. if it breaks vanilla chars . it might be annoying.
dont be shy about suggestions people. the way mods work for GD is annoying so we really do need these compilations ;\

0007 - 12:12 AM 5/21/2016
merged in the tt300 version of stasher mod for all our stashing needs
next up: gonna take another crack at merging the ranger / necro
masteries with coronus now that i know a bit more about .tex/etc
trickery
added an arachnophobia version too

0006 - 6:08 PM 5/20/2016
Merged in Coronus Mod
Attempted to merge Necro/Ranger/etc mod - cancelled. after unpacking it.
it was too big and contained too much stuff that seemed redundantly
stored like the base masteries. Needs more analysis
Added mod credits in the loading tips

0005-3:50 PM 5/19/2016
toned down grimmest a bit since i was having issues just wading through
on my rig (i7 5820K with 970x2) so I want to have a challenge but i also
want silky smooth 120 fps. this means i've also nerfed XP
tremendously. that is ok.
also omega mod added. works 100%

0004-3:13 PM 5/19/2016
I figured out the legendary affix stuff thanks to NateATon. I had to run
a full folder diff to find all the changes. basically the changes are
purely in the lootttable DBR files. the affix files were to increase run
speed only. and there were many global edits to items which i did not
use such as components usable in all slots.
definately level>100 is broken as heck. so i set the max level to 100
for now. maybe its ok. can i increase devotion skill levels? that
could be fun.

0003-9:50 AM 5/19/2016
elfe in http://www.grimdawn.com/forums/showthread.php?t=38578
is saying that I can go over level 100, so i set the max level back to 200 and will do more testing.
i tried looking at what he suggested, it doest seem like there are limits set. i copied the grimmest stuff
also level>100 seems to break access to the challenge areas. the doors are unresponsive.

also i wonder can i globally edit dbr files or run sql like queries
against them??? ill look into it. as it is the only way to do massive
edits like this.....

0002-2:51 AM 5/19/2016
grimmest worked. yay - but only if i set the cap to level 100.. thats not soo bad. 15 more levels ;\
still need to figure out legendary/epic affixes from NateATon's hard research and work. Thank you again senpai.

0001-2:52 PM 5/18/2016
initial version
not done *affixes will be added to epic and legendary items
done * levels will be uncapped for players and monster scaling
levels are 200 but monsters aren't spawning must merge in grimmest`
