tagSkillClassDescription07=A cult that remained secret for years, Necromancers were once brothers with the Order of the Death's Vigil until they faced persecution at the hands of the empire and decided to stay hidden from this world using their dark arts. Necromancers use their dark power to claim the bodies of the dead, raising skeleton armies to their service, casting terrible curses at their opponents or devastating them with mighty dark spells, they weaken, trap and destroy those who stand in their path, while empowering their allies using their dark skills. They are usually watching from the backround as their armies crush their opponents to oblivion. The legends say that those strong enough and worthy become undead themselves, while keeping their sanity.
tagSkillClassDescription08=Before Grim Dawn, the ranger was the existence most fatal probably on a continent.

Sword magicks, the art of seen and then, suddenly, unseen, they got it from the Arlequin, and don't let anyone tell you different! I mean, who cares about "facts" and "history" anyways? The Arlequin is here to entertain, not bore you with such silly things as facts! The Arlequin lives for the show, and the show is bloody.
