# Darkest Dawn #
################
tagSkillClassDescription14=Followers of Uroboruuk, the legendary original Necromancer, study dark arts some consider "unholy". To the skilled Necromancer, death is but a threshold that may be crossed both ways, as they wield arcane energies to command walking bones and spirits alike. Should the conjured dead not suffice, a Necromancer's affinity towards life allows them to claim it with their own hands and morbid spells. 

tagSkillClassDescription15=Rumored to be a small sect within the Emperor's Nightblades, Illusionists are semi-mythical manipulators and puppetmasters. They kill not with a whirlwind of blades, but with a drop of rage directly instilled into a target's head, with paralysis, and with confusion. The battlefield is but a play waiting to be orchestrated, and the Illusionist's willpower determines the outcome.
