#CLASS ELEMENTALIST
#ENUMERATION 12

#CLASS TERROR KNIGHT
#ENUMERATION 13

tagSkillClassDescription12=Traditionally, Elementalists were persons of entertainment in Elonis, whose affinity for conjuration was most intriguing. What with the occurence of the Grim Dawn, however, they have found a means to weaponize their mastery of the three elements: Fire, Cold, and Lightning.
tagSkillClassDescription13=Hailing from the obsidian forest of Elonis, Terror Knights engage in combat according to two doctrines: Victory at any cost; Defeat only when there is nothing more to kill. To witness a Terror Knight in action is to witness the spread of insanity.
